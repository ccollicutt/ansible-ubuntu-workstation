# Ansible Ubuntu Workstation

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is an Ansible playbook to setup an Ubuntu workstation, right now based on 14.10.

Hopefully at some point it will be setting up a lot of security related configuration.

## 1. Install ansible

```bash
curtis@kane:~$ sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
curtis@kane:~$ sudo pip install ansible
```
